# Planetary Boundaries


planetary boundaries represent [[tipping-points]] beyond which catastrophic changes can occur in [[earth-system]] processes

They include:
- [[climate-change]]
- [[ocean-acidification]]
- [[ozone-depletion]]
- disruption of [[biogeochemical-flows]]
  - [[nitrogen-loading]]
  - [[phosphorus-loading]]
- [[freshwater-consumption]]
- [[land-use]]
  - use [[deforestation]] as a proxy
- [[change-in-biodiversity-integrity]]
  - use [[functional-diversity]] and [[genetic-diversity]] as control variables
- [[atmospheric-aerosol-loading]]
- [[chemical-pollution]]
