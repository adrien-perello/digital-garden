# Ocean deoxygenation

## Causes

- warming ocean leads to
  - [[reduced-oxygen-solubility]] (oceans absorb less oxygen)
  - [[weakening-of-ocean-currents]] + [[increased-water-stratification]] (warm water is more buoyant than cool water) leads to [[reduced-oxygen-mixing]] between surface water (richer in oxygen) and deeper waters (naturally less oxygenated)
  - [[increased-respiration-rates-of-marine-life]]
- [[eutrophication]] also leads to [[increased-respiration-rates-of-marine-life]] because the [[organic-matter-decomposition]] of [[phytoplankton]] consumes oxygen
